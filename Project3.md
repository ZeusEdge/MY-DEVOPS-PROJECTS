Tried creating the routes sub-folder => Mistakenly exited the Todo folder

Listed the list of folders in root => Todo folder has been deleted
  
Todo folder np longer accessible => Need to restart the whole process

Restarted the whole process, Postman was working until I killed a node service (not cool)
  
Could not figure out how to restart the service

Would have to restart a new instance (yawns)

Noticed that index.js has to be running on the console for the web browser to display the right content

Tested the POST, GET, and DELETE requests from POSTMAN => ALL actions were successful
